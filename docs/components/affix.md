# Affix

> The affix component toggles `position: fixed` on and off, emulating the effect found with `position: sticky`.

::: tip
You must provide CSS for the positioning and width of your affixed content.
:::

::: warning
Do not use affix on an element contained in a relatively positioned element, such as a pulled or pushed column.

## Example
