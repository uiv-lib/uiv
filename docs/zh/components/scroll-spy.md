# ScrollSpy 滚动监听

> Update nav targets based on scroll position automatically.

## Example

Scroll the area below the navbar and watch the active class change. The dropdown sub items will be highlighted as well:

<scroll-spy-example/>

<<< @/.vitepress/components/scroll-spy/example.vue

## Usage

```
v-scrollspy:arg="option"
```

Where:

* `arg` is the ID (without prefix `#`) of the element to scrollspy on (optional), leave it empty to spy on `<body>`.
* `options` is an object of configuration (optional).

### Bootstrap nav required

Scrollspy currently requires the use of a Bootstrap nav component for proper highlighting of active links.

### Resolvable ID targets required

Navbar links must have resolvable id targets. For example, a `<a href="#home">home</a>` must correspond to something in the DOM like `<div id="home"></div>`.

### Relative positioning required

No matter the implementation method, scrollspy requires the use of `position: relative;` on the element you're spying on. In most cases this is the `<body>`. When scrollspying on elements other than the `<body>`, be sure to have a `height` set and `overflow-y: scroll;` applied.
